# PowerPointer

PowerPointer is an easy to use ruby library allowing you to create .pptx files from scratch.

## Mission

* To provide full support for the features of .pptx files.
* To provide two levels of abstraction:
  1. A set of low-level classes that export directly to .pptx files.
  2. A high-level set of classes that encapsulate the low-level classes in a very simple, yet powerful and intuitive, way.
  
## Contributing

At this point, PowerPointer is at such an early stage that having more people would hurt the project more than it would help. However as soon as the basic code structure is finished, all contributions are welcome!
