# PowerPointer

PowerPointer is an easy to use ruby library allowing you to create .pptx files from scratch.

## Mission

* To provide full support for the features of .pptx files.
* To provide two levels of abstraction:
  1. A set of low-level classes that export directly to .pptx files.
  2. A high-level set of classes that encapsulate the low-level classes, in a very simple, yet powerful and intuitive, way.
